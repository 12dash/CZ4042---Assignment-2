## Data

The folder data contains the raw data from the two sources : 
* WASSA Data
* CROWDFLOWER Data

## Embeddings
The embeddings needs to be downloaded manually. The downloaded file needs to be stored in a directory called embeddings inside the Jupyter directory. 

The embeddings can be downloaded from the link : https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

## Source Code

Jupyter directory contains the source code to run the directory 

For respective dataset, the file name is prefixed with the dataset name. For example,  LSTM architecture on WASSA dataset can be found in WASSA - LSTM

The pre-trained models were trained on COLAB. 

## Models

The trained models are stored in the directory Jupyter/model
